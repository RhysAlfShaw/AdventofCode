# 2024 Advent of Code

For this years Advent of Code event I will be writing my solutions in C. 
I want to use as little external modules and write all functions myself.

An additional thing is I want to have very preformative solution. So I will benchmark all my solutions, and strive for a minimalist solution.

Only time will tell how this will go.

Hopefully I can do more solutions than last year before I get distracted by other work.
